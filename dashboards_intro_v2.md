### What is a Dashboard?

When you create a dashboard, you can immediately drag and drop a chart and specify the metrics you want to see.

All dashboards group a set of related charts. All charts in a dashboard share [display
preferences](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_dashboards.html#set-dashboard-display-preferences),
[variables](https://docs.wavefront.com/dashboards_variables.html), and [events](https://docs.wavefront.com/charts_events_displaying.html#controlling-events-overlays).

Within dashboards you use [sections](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_dashboards.html#organize-dashboards-with-sections) to further organize charts.
