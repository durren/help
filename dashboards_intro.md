### What is a Dashboard?

Dashboards group a set of related [charts](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_charts.html). All charts in a dashboard share [display
preferences](https://docs.wavefront.com/dashboards_managing.html#setting-dashboard-preferences),
[variables](https://docs.wavefront.com/dashboards_variables.html), and [
events](https://docs.wavefront.com/charts_events_displaying.html#controlling-events-overlays). Within
dashboards you use [sections](https://docs.wavefront.com/dashboards_managing.html#configuring-dashboard-sections) to further organize charts.
