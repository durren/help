### Managing Service Accounts

A service account is for services that use the Wavefront API to perform certain tasks. Service accounts use a token to authenticate and are constrained from performing certain UI operations.

From this page, you can:
* Create a service account.
* Disable and enable a service account.
* Generate a new API token. The service can use the token to authenticate to Wavefront. It's rarely necessary to generate a new token.
* Assign permissions to a service account. In most situations, it's best to assign permissions directly to the service account.
