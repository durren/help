### Managing Users

From this page, you can:
* Invite other users to your company's Wavefront account.
* Add users to groups and remove them from groups.
* Grant users permissions or revoke permissions.

If you select a permission in the left pane, you see which users have the permission.
If you select a group in the left pane, you see which users belong to the group.

After you've added the user, it usually makes sense to manage permissions for many users from the **User Group Management** page available from the gear icon.
