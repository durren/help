<p>Intelligent alerting helps DevOps and developer teams avoid alert fatigue. Wavefront offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over a hundred functions for designing the [perfect alert](/dashboard/tour-the-perfect-alert) for any anomaly.</li>
<li>Backtesting existing data to see when an alert would have fired in the past.</li>
<li>Deactivating alerts to avoid wasting time on sidelined systems.
</ul>

<p>You ultimately experience fewer false alarms and can more accurately predict the behavior of your applications and environments.</p>

<p>After designing your alerts, configure your preferred channels to receive notifications of alert state changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email</li>
<li>PagerDuty and VictorOps</li>
<li>HipChat and Slack</li>
<li>Custom webhooks</li>
</ul>
