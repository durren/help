<p>Charts are the primary way you view the status of your metrics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Display your data in line, point, and stacked area charts.</li>
<li>Highlight critical metrics with sparklines</li>
<li>Guide your users in Markdown charts</li>
</ul>

<p>While charts provide a window into your company's data, dashboards let you prioritize and group those windows in a meaningful way. Dashboards allow you to quickly compare different data sets, alter time windows for all data sets, and save those windows for future use.</p>

<p>Charts and dashboards both support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time scale select, reset, and zoom in and out</li>
<li>Isolating sources and series</li>
<li>Displaying system and user-defined events</li>
</ul>
